        /* INSTRUCTIONS: 
1. The client wants the image to bleed full width, the text in the paragraphs to be 80% 
of the browser window (but wants a smaller margin on mobile) and wants the code to 
be semantically correct.  

2. First link the bootstrap-reboot.css file (from the URL below) within the head
of this file.

3. Begin to build a semantic structure for the page that allows the
image to go full width but the text to have a margin from the edge of
the browser. 

4. 
a.) Wrap everything within the body in a main element, 
b.) create two section elements within it, 
c.) put the full width image in the first section, 
d.) put the paragraphs within a div in the second section
e.) write a rule that sets the paragraphs off from the edge of the browser via 
a class you create and add to this div.
f.) write a media query to change the div's width to be larger at a mobile size.

                <p>Browsers have a default margin of 8 pixels on the body element. (If you inspect the body
                    element, you will see the "user agent stylesheet" sets the body to have an 8px margin.)
                    However, the client wants the image of the design center to bleed full width
                    with the text's line length limited at a desktop view.</p>

                <p>They even gave you
                    a mockup they made in Figma:</p>

                <p>Working developers today do not write a whole bunch of
                    browser default rules. Instead they use a pre-made set of rules <a
